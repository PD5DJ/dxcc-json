# DXCC JSON

This repository contains a JSON reference for amateur radio
[DX Century Club (DXCC)](https://www.arrl.org/dxcc) entities as maintained by the
[Amateur Radio Relay League (ARRL)](https://www.arrl.org). This is intended for consumption by other
amateur radio software.

The reference data started from the
[ARRL Country Lists & Prefixes](https://www.arrl.org/country-lists-prefixes) page, specifically the
[February 2020 text listing](https://www.arrl.org/files/file/DXCC/2020%20Current_Deleted.txt). That
document was imported into a
[Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N1eMxi54yTwvizOzVeugWtLxfXGfK92WOavEjnfIdFw/edit#gid=0)
for formatting and cleansing. I added country codes, unicode flag glyphs and callsign prefix regular
expressions (regexes), and exported the spreadsheet as the CSV contained in this repository.
